Description:
-----------------
Over in the UK the British library has started the continual recording of 22 TV stations for archiving purposes, with a focus is on current affairs. Their solution uses some pretty high-tech, high-spec computer equipment. The idea behind Torrent TV is to look to achieve the same thing, but adopting a crowd-sourced approach to capturing the TV content.

You could think of the project as a crowd-sourced personal video recorder (PVR), if that isn't a contradition in terms! If taking this as the focus for the Smoke and Mirrors project, then this would shift emphasis away from the need to have a continually expanding archive, to one that concentrates on keeping a fixed-sized sliding window of TV content available (say the last month of TV). Here, enriched crowd-sourced ideas could include: letting users mark the precise beginning of a show so later users can start watching the show at just the right point; and providing sub-titles and/or translated sub-titles (stimulated, for example, through an incentive scheme?)
